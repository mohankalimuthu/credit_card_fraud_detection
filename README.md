## 📌 Abstract

   - Credit card fraud is a critical issue for financial institutions worldwide.

   - This project develops a machine learning–based fraud detection model to identify fraudulent transactions from a highly imbalanced dataset.

   - The aim is to reduce false negatives (frauds predicted as legitimate) while maintaining strong performance across metrics.

## 🎯 Project Target

   ✅ Build a classification model to detect fraud vs legitimate transactions.

   ✅ Handle imbalanced datasets with resampling (SMOTE, undersampling).

   ✅ Provide a reproducible fraud detection pipeline for real-world usage.

## 📊 Metrics Required

   📌 **Accuracy** → Overall correctness of predictions.

   📌 **Precision** → Fraction of predicted frauds that were actually frauds.

   📌 **Recall** → Fraction of actual frauds correctly identified.

   📌 **F1-score** → Harmonic mean of precision & recall.

   📌 **ROC-AUC Score** → Ability to distinguish fraud from non-fraud.

   📌 **Confusion Matrix** → Visualization of classification results.

## 🤖 Fraud Detection Workflow

   - Data Preprocessing

   - Feature scaling

   - Handling missing values

   - Balancing dataset (SMOTE / undersampling)

   - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

   - Distribution of fraud vs legitimate transactions

   - Correlation analysis

   - Model Training

   - Logistic Regression

   - Random Forest

   - XGBoost

   - Support Vector Machine (optional)

   - Prediction & Evaluation

   - Model testing on unseen data

   - Performance metrics and visualization

## 🧩 Models Used & Example Results

   🔹 Logistic Regression → ~94% accuracy

   🔹 Random Forest → ~97% accuracy

   🔹 XGBoost → ~98% ROC-AUC

  🔹 SVM (optional) → Used for baseline comparison

## ✨ Features

 ✔️ Real-world imbalanced dataset (fraud vs non-fraud).

✔️ Preprocessing with feature scaling and balancing.

✔️ Multiple supervised ML algorithms tested.

✔️ Evaluation with imbalanced classification metrics.
